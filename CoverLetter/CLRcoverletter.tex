%\lettersection{About Me}
%I hereby present myself as a professional in the Data Science realm. Before graduating from my bachelor I was developing as the leader of several analytics projects for different entities of the government, public services and private industry. Then I sold a Data Mining project to a Headhunting consultancy. After graduating I began with a start up in the analytics and Internet of thing realm, is still going on. Then I started working as a consultant in a Big Data project. After I began a master degree in Data Mining. I like to work in a fast and efficient manner, with visible deadlines and exciting teamwork. I self regulate my time and activities and have experience as team leader and project management. I like to be honest, truthful and tolerant. I'm willing to relocate anywhere in the world.  

\lettersection{Technologist}

I had the fortune to receive a multidisciplinary training as a \textbf{scientist} in the bachelor. Being able to conceive scientific discovery from the theoretical model, experimental design, electronic instrumentation, all to the way to data processing. I was formed in several basic sciences, mainly, mathematics, physics, computer and natural sciences. Each semester we had the opportunity to do an internship in one of the many research laboratories present in campus, at the end of which an oral presentation and written publication was presented in a colloquium. 

\lettersection{Data Scientist}

I started working in a \textbf{Big Data} consultancy and acquired business and practical knowledge of the Data science field. Then I decided to study an European Master in \textbf{Data Mining} and Knowledge Management both in France and Italy in which I was able to receive multiple courses related to research topics in the data science field. I complemented my formation taking Massive Online Open Courses and developing outside the academia in my free time. 

\lettersection{Entrepreneur}

Before graduating from my bachelor I was leading several data analytics projects for government and public entities. They covered from data generation, cleaning, filtering, aggregation, statistical analysis and visualisation. After graduating I launched a \textbf{start up} with the aim of providing cloud based processing and analytical services for the local industry. Several projects were developed to generate web services for capturing information and later processing along with Internet of Things approach to smart home appliances. 

\vspace{1.2cm}
Having exposed my main characteristics I hope you can find evidence of my ability to design, lead and execute analytical projects both for research oriented and business environments.
